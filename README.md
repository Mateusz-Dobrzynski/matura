# matura
Scripts created as a form of preparation for high school finals (pl. _matura_) in computer science.
The practical part of the exam consists of three parts, one of them being programming in a chosen language.
Since the other two revolve around  MS Excel and Access, they are not included in this repository.

## Repository structure
- `YYYY-MM` – solutions of tasks present in exam sheets from previous years. An official list of exam sheets
(2015 and newer) can be found
[here](https://www.oke.poznan.pl/cms,108,arkusze.htm?p=0). Older exam sheets can be accessed via an unofficial archive
[arkusze.pl](https://arkusze.pl/informatyka-matura-poziom-rozszerzony/)
- `Workbook` – solutions of exemplary examination tasks published by the Central Examination Committee (pl. _CKE_)
The workbook can be found [here](https://cke.gov.pl/images/_EGZAMIN_MATURALNY_OD_2015/Materialy/Zbiory_zadan/Matura_Zbi%C3%B3r_zada%C5%84_Informatyka.pdf).
Input data and proposed solutions of the tasks can be found [here](https://cke.gov.pl/egzamin-maturalny/egzamin-maturalny-w-formule-2015/materialy-dodatkowe/materialy-dla-uczniow-i-nauczycieli/zbiory-zadan/)
- `kata` – implementations of algorithms included in the curriculum. Students are expected to memorize these algorithms,
and be able to reproduce them quickly, so it's good to practice their implementation – hence the name referring to coding kata
